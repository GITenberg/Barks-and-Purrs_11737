<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><i>Madame</i>:</p>

<p><i>There are moments when one seems to
come to life. One looks about and distinguishes
a creature whose foot-print closely
resembles the ace of spades. The thing
says: bow-wow. It is a dog. One looks
again. The ace of spades is now an ace of
clubs. The thing says: pffffffff&mdash;and it
is a cat.</i></p>

<p><i>This is the history of the visible world
and in particular, that of my god-children,
Toby-Dog and Kiki-the-Demure. They are
so natural&mdash;I use the word in the sense in
which it is applicable to the savages of
Oceania&mdash;that all their acts conspire to
make of life, a very simple proposition.
These are animals in the fullest sense of the
word&mdash;animos&mdash;if I may employ the original
orthography, capable of exclaiming
with those of Faust</i>:</p>

<p class="poetry">&quot;The fool knows it not!<br />
He knows not the pot,<br />
He knows not the kettle.&quot;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><i>And as such, Madame, you have placed
them exactly where they should be: their
earthly Paradise is the apartment of
Monsieur Willy. In your salon, the probable
palm and rubber-plant give the impression
of luxuriant Edenic flora, relatively
speaking, and illustrate the transmogrification
which is to allow M. Gaston Deschamps&mdash;critic
of a</i> &quot;Temps&quot; <i>plus-que-pass&eacute;&mdash;to
announce to the wilderness
(where he speaks familiarly of Chateaubriand),
and to the Coll&egrave;ge de France, how well
he can admire and understand a true poet</i>.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><i>For you are a true poet and I will declare
it freely, not concerning myself more with
the legends Parisians have the habit of weaving
about every celebrity. They admire
Gauguin and Verlaine, not so much for their
originality, as for their eccentricities. And
so it happens that certain persons, unacquainted
with the nameless sentiment, the
order and purity, the thousand interior virtues
which guide you, persist in saying that
you wear your hair short and that Willy is
bald.</i></p>

<p><i>Must I then&mdash;living at Orthez&mdash;tell</i>
Tout-Paris <i>who you are, present you to all
who know you&mdash;I who have never seen you</i>?</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><i>I will say then, that Madame Colette
Willy never had short hair, that she
does not wear masculine attire; that her cat
does not accompany her when she goes to a
concert, that her friend's dog does not drink
from a tumbler. It is inexact to say that
Mme. Colette Willy works in a squirrel's
cage, or performs upon trapeze and flying
rings, and can reach with her toe the
nape of her neck. Madame Colette Willy
has never ceased to be the</i> plain woman <i>par
excellence, who rises at dawn to give oats to
the horse, maize to the chickens, cabbage to
the rabbits, groundsel to the canaries, snails
to the ducks and bran-water to the pigs. At
eight o'clock, summer and winter, she prepares
the caf&eacute; au lait for her maid&mdash;and
herself. Scarcely a day passes that she
does not meditate upon this admirable book</i>:</p>

<p><i>Orchard, kitchen-garden, stable, poultry-yard,
bee-hive and hot-house, have no further
mysteries for Madame Colette Willy. They
say, she refused to divulge her secret for the
destruction of mole-crickets to &quot;a great
statesman, who prayed her on his knees.&quot;</i></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><i>Madame Colette Willy is in no way different
from the description I have just given
of her. I am aware that certain folk, having
met her in society, insist upon making her
very complex. A little more, and they would
have ascribed to her the tastes of the mustiest
symbolists&mdash;and one knows how far
from pleasing are those Muses' robes,
how odious the yellow bandeaux above faces
expressionless as eggs. Robes and bandeaux
are to-day relegated to drawers in
the Capitol at Toulouse, from which they
will never be taken more, except when occasion
calls for the howling of official alexandrines
in honor of M. Gaston Deschamps,
Jaur&egrave;s, or Vercing&eacute;torix.</i></p>

<p><i>Madame Colette Willy rises to-day on
the world of Letters as the poetess&mdash;at
last!--who, with the tip of her slipper
sends all the painted, laureled, cothurn&egrave;d,
lyre-carrying Muses&mdash;that, from Monselet
to Renan, have roused the aspirations of
classes in Rhetoric&mdash;rolling, from the top
to the bottom of Parnassus.</i></p>

<p><i>How charming she is thus&mdash;presenting
her bull-dog and her cat with as much assurance
as Diana would her hound, or a
Bacchante her tiger.</i></p>

<p><i>See her apple-cheeks, her eyes like blue
myosotis, her lips&mdash;poppy-petals, and her
ivy-like grace! Tell me if this way of leaning
against the green barrier of her garden-close,
or of lying under the murmurous
arbor of mid-Summer, is not worth the
starched manner, that old magistrate de
Vigny&mdash;with his neckcloth wound three
times around, and rigid in his trousers'
straps&mdash;imposed upon his goddesses?
Madame Colette Willy is a live woman, a
real woman, who has dared to be natural
and who resembles a little village bride far
more than a perverse woman of letters</i>.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><i>Read her book and you shall see how accurate
are my assertions. It has pleased
Madame Colette Willy to embody in a couple
of delightful animals, the aroma of gardens,
the freshness of the field, the heat of
state-roads,&mdash;the passions of men....
For through this girlish laughter ringing
in the forest, I tell you, I hear the sobbing of
a well-spring. One does not stoop to a
poodle or tom-cat, without feeling the heart
wrung with dumb anguish. One is sensible,
in comparing ourselves to them, of all that
separates and of all that unites us</i>.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><i>A dog's eyes hold the sorrow of having,
since the earliest days of creation,
licked the whip of his incorrigible persecutor
in vain. For nothing has mollified
man&mdash;not the prey brought him by a
famishing spaniel, nor the humble guilelessness
of the shepherd-dog, guarding the peace
of the shadowy flocks under the stars</i>.</p>

<p><i>A tragic fear shines in the cat's eyes.
&quot;What are you going to do to me now?&quot;
it seems to ask, lying on a rubbish-heap, a
prey to mange and hunger&mdash;and feverishly
it waits the new torture that will shatter its
nervous system</i>.</p>

<p><i>But have no fear... Madame Colette
Willy is very kind. She quickly dispels
the hereditary dread of Toby-Dog and
Kiki-the-Demure. She meliorates the race,
so that dogs and cats will learn in the end
that it is less dull to frequent a poet than an
unhappy Coll&egrave;ge de France candidate&mdash;had
this candidate proven more copiously still,
that the author of &quot;M&eacute;moires d'Outre-Tombe&quot;
had topsyturvily described the jawbone
of the Crocodile</i>.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><i>Toby-Dog and Kiki-the-Demure well
know that their mistress is a lady who
would do no harm&mdash;neither to a piece of
sugar nor to a mouse; a lady who, for our
delight, jumps a rope she has woven of
flower-words which she never bruises, and
with which she perfumes us; a lady who sings,
with the voice of a clear French rivulet, that
wistful tenderness which makes the hearts of
animals beat so fast</i>.</p>

<p><i>The sunny porch</i>. TOBY-DOG <i>and</i> KIKI-THE-DEMURE
<i>sprawl on the hot stone-flags,
taking their after luncheon nap.
The silence of Sunday prevails, yet</i> TOBY-DOG
<i>is not asleep: the flies and a heavy
luncheon torment him. Hind-quarters
flattened out frog-fashion, he drags himself
on his belly up to</i> KIKI-THE-DEMURE
<i>whose striped body is perfectly quiet</i>.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Are you asleep?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>purrs feebly</i>)</p>

<p>Are you even alive? You're so flat! You
look like the empty skin of a cat.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>in faltering tones</i>)</p>

<p>L-e-t&mdash;m-e&mdash;a-l-o-n-e....</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Not sick, are you?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>No.... Let me alone. I'm asleep. I'm
not even conscious of my body. What torment
to live with you! I've eaten, it's two
o'clock, let's sleep.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>I can't. Something's made a ball in my
stomach. It means to go down I guess,
but very slowly. And then,&mdash;these <i>flies</i>,
these <i>flies</i>! The eyes start out of my head
at the sight of one of them. I'm all jaws,
bristling with terrible teeth (just hear them
snap), yet the infernal things escape me.
Oh! my ears! Oh! my poor, sensitive,
brown belly! My feverish nose! There! ... you see? ... right on my nose!
<i>What</i> shall I do? I squint all I can ...
two of them now? ... No ... only one ... no, two! ... I toss them up like bits
of sugar and it's the empty air I snap....
I'm worn out. I detest the sun, and the flies,
and everything! ...</p>

<p>(<i>He wails</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>sitting up, his eyes pale
from the light and sleepiness</i>)</p>

<p>Well, you've succeeded in waking me.
That's all you wanted, isn't it? My dreams
are gone! These flies that you're pursuing
&mdash;I hardly felt their little teasing feet
through my thick fur. The merest touch,
like a caress, now and then thrilled along
the silky sloping hairs which clothe me....
But then you never act with any discretion.
Your vulgar gayety is a nuisance, and when
sad you howl like a low comedian.</p>

<!--<img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/024.gif" width="222" height="287" />-->

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>bitterly</i>)</p>

<p>If you woke up just to tell me <i>that</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>correcting</i>)</p>

<p>Of course you'll remember 'twas <i>you</i> woke
me.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>I was so uncomfortable, I wanted someone
to help me, to give me a word of encouragement....</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p><i>I</i> don't know any digestive words.</p>

<p>(<i>Pause</i>.)</p>

<p>Fancy their giving <i>me</i> a bad character
when ... Just examine your conscience a
bit and compare us. Hunger and heat wear
you out and drive you mad; cold makes your
blood curdle....</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>vexed</i>)</p>

<p>Mine is a sensitive nature.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>A demoniacal nature, you mean!</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>No, I don't mean that. You&mdash;you're a
monstrous egoist.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Perhaps.... You and the Two-Paws
don't understand what you're pleased to call
a cat's egoism.... Our instinct of self-preservation,
our dignity, our modest reserve,
our attitude of weary renunciation
(which comes of the hopelessness of ever
being understood by them), they dub, in
haphazard fashion, egoism. You're not a
very discriminating dog, but at least you're
free from prejudice. Will <i>you</i> understand
me better? A cat is a guest in the house,
not a plaything. Truly these are strange
times we're living in! The Two-Paws, He
and She, have <i>they</i> alone the right to be
sad or joyful, to lick plates, to scold, or to
go about the house indulging their capricious
humors? I too have <i>my</i> whims, <i>my</i> sorrows,
<i>my</i> irregular appetite, <i>my</i> hours of reverie
when I wish to be alone....</p>

<!--<img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/027.gif" width="277" height="237" />-->

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>attentive and conscientious</i>)</p>

<p>I'm listening, but I can hardly follow
what you say. It's so complicated&mdash;a bit
over my head, you know. But you astonish
me! Are they in the habit of hindering
you in your changeful moods? You mew,
and they open the door. You lie on the
paper&mdash;the sacred paper He's scratching on&mdash;He
moves away, marvelous condescension!--and
leaves you his soiled page.
You meander up and down his scratching
table, obviously in quest of mischief, your
nose wrinkled up, your tail giving quick
little jerks back and forth like a pendulum.
She watches you laughing, while He announces
&quot;the promenade of devastation.&quot;
How then, can you accuse Them&mdash;</p>

<!--<img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/028.gif" width="584" height="202" />-->

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>insincere</i>)</p>

<p>I don't accuse Them. After all, psychological
subtleties are not in your line.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Don't speak so fast. I need time to understand.
It seems to me&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>slyly</i>)</p>

<p>Pray, don't hurry! Your digestion
might suffer in consequence.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>unconscious of the irony</i>)</p>

<p>You're right! I've some trouble in expressing
myself to-day.&mdash;Well, here goes:
it seems to me that of the two of us it's you
they make the most of, and yet <i>you</i> do all
the grumbling.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>A dog's logic, that! The more one gives
the more I demand.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>That's wrong. It's indiscreet.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Not at all. I have a right to everything.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>To everything? And I?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>I don't imagine you lack anything, do
you?</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Ah, I don't know. Sometimes in my very
happiest moments, I feel like crying. My
eyes grow dim, my heart seems to choke me.
I would like to be sure, in such times of anguish,
that everybody loves me; that there
is nowhere in the world a sad dog behind a
closed door, that no evil will ever come....</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>jeering</i>)</p>

<p>And <i>then</i> what dreadful thing happens?</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>You know very well! Inevitably, at that
moment She appears, carrying a bottle with
horrible yellow stuff floating in it&mdash;Castor
Oil! Wilful and unfeeling, she holds me
between her strong knees, opens my jaws&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Close them tighter!</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>But I'm afraid of hurting her&mdash;and my
tongue, horrified, tastes the slimy mawkish
stuff. I choke and spit, my poor face is
convulsed and the end of this torture is
long in coming.... You've seen me afterwards
dragging myself around, melancholy,
my head hanging, listening to the unwholesome
glouglou the oil makes in my stomach. ...</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/031.gif" width="525" height="164" /></p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Once when I was little She tried to give
<i>me</i> castor oil. I scratched and bit her so,
she never tried again. Ha! She must have
thought she held the devil between her knees.
I squirmed, blew fire through my nostrils,
multiplied my twenty claws by a hundred,
my teeth by one thousand, and finally&mdash;disappeared
as if by magic.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>I wouldn't dare do that. You see, I
love her. I love her enough to forgive her
even the torture of the bath.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>interested</i>)</p>

<p>You do? Tell me how it feels. It makes
me shiver all over, just to see her putting
you in the water.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/032.gif" width="223" height="210" align="right">
<p>Alas.... Listen then, and pity me.
Sometimes, when She's come out of her
tub with nothing on her but her skin, her
soft hairless skin that I lick respectfully,&mdash;She
spills out more warm water,
throws in a brown brick which smells of
tar, and calls, &quot;Toby!&quot; That's enough!
The soul quits my body; my legs shake under
me. Something shines on the water&mdash;the
picture of a window all twisted out of
shape&mdash;it dances about and blinds me.
She seizes me, poor swooning thing that I
am, and plunges me in.... Ye Gods! From
that time on I'm lost.... My one hope is in
her. My eyes fasten themselves on hers,
while a close warmth sticks to me like another
skin on top of mine.... The brick's
all foamy now ... I smell tar ... my
eyes and nostrils smart ... there are
storms in my ears. She grows excited,
breathes loud and fast, laughs, and scrubs
me light-heartedly. At last She rescues me,
fishing me out by the nape of my neck, I paw
the air, begging for life; then comes the
rough towel and the warm coverlet where, exhausted,
I relish my convalescence....</p>



<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>deeply impressed</i>)</p>

<p>Calm yourself.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Jove! The telling it alone! ... But&mdash;you
old sly-boots&mdash;didn't I see her one day
armed with a sponge standing over <i>you,</i>
holding <i>you</i> down on the toilet table?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>quite embarrassed, lashing his tail</i>)</p>

<p>An old story! The long, fluffy hairs
on my legs (which give them the outline of
a Zouave's) had somehow gotten dirty. She
insisted upon washing me. I persuaded her
that I suffered atrociously under the
sponge....</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>What a fibber you are! Did She believe
you?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>'Um ... at first. It was my own fault
tho' when She didn't. Turned over on my
back, I proffered the candid belly, the terrified
and forgiving eyes of a lamb about to be
sacrificed. I felt a slight coolness, nothing
more. A fear that my sensibilities might be
destroyed, took possession of me. My rhythmical
wailings increased, then subsided, then
went up again like the noise of the sea (you
know the strength of my voice). I imitated
the calf, the whipped child, the cat in the
night, the wind under the door. Little by
little I grew enraptured with my own song,
so that long after She had finished soiling me
with cold water I continued wailing, my eyes
fixed on the ceiling. Then She laughed tactlessly
and cried out, &quot;You're as untruthful
as a woman!&quot;</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/034.gif" width="501" height="259" /></p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>with conviction</i>)</p>

<p>That <i>was</i> annoying.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>I was angry with her the entire afternoon.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Oh, as to sulking, you do your share! <i>I</i>
never can. I forget injuries.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>dryly</i>)</p>

<p>Not mine.... Dignity doesn't trouble
<i>you</i> any! My word! I'm often ashamed
for you. You love everybody. You take
all sorts of rebuffs without even raising your
back. You're as pleasant and as banal as
a public garden.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Don't you believe it, you ill-bred cat!
You think you know everything and you
don't understand simple politeness. Frankly
now, would you have me snarl at His or Her
friends' heels,&mdash;well-dressed people who
know my name (lots of people <i>I</i> don't know
know my name) and good-naturedly pull
my ears?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>I hate new faces.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>I don't love them either&mdash;whatever you
say. I love&mdash;Her and Him.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>And I, Him&mdash;and Her.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Oh, I guessed <i>your</i> preference long ago.
There's a sort of secret understanding between
you two&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/037.gif" width="528" height="190" /></p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>smiling mysteriously
and abandoning himself to his reverie</i>)</p>

<p>An understanding, yes&mdash;secret and profound.
He rarely speaks but makes a
noise like a mouse, scratching his paper.
It's for Him I've treasured up my little
heart, my precious cat's heart, and He,
without words, has given me his. This exchange
makes me happy and reserved.
Now and then with that pretty, wayward,
ruling instinct which makes us cats rivals of
women, I try my power over him. When
we are alone, I point my ears forward devilishly
as a sign that I'm about to spring
upon his scratching paper. The tap, tap,
tap of my paws straight through pens
and letters and everything scattered about,
is addressed to him as well as the insistent
miauling when I beg for liberty. &quot;Hymn
to the Door-Knob,&quot; He laughingly calls it,
or &quot;The Plaint of the Sequestered Cat.&quot;
The tender contemplation of my inspiring
eyes is for him alone; they weigh on his bent
head, until the look I'm calling searches and
meets mine in a shock of souls, so foreseen
and so sweet, that I must needs close my lids
to hide the exquisite shyness I feel.</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/038.gif" width="542" height="154" /></p>

<p>As for Her, she flutters about too much,
often jostles me, holds my paws together
and rocks me in the air, pets me in excited
fashion, laughs aloud at me, imitates my
voice too well&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>moved with indignation</i>)</p>

<p>You're very hard to please! I certainly
love Him; he's good and pretends not to see
my faults, so that he won't have to scold,
but She's the most beautiful thing in the
world to me, the dearest and&mdash;the most
difficult to understand. The sound of her
step enchants me, her changeful eyes dispense
happiness&mdash;and trouble. She's like
Destiny itself, she never hesitates. Even
torture from her hands&mdash;you know how She
teases me?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Cruelly.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>No, not cruelly, but artfully. I never can
tell what's coming next. This morning She
bent down as if to speak to me, lifted
one of my &quot;tiny elephant's ears,&quot; as She
calls them, and sent a sharp cry into it, which
went to the very back of my brain.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Horrors!</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Was it right or wrong? I can't decide
even now. It started waves of nervousness
running madly through me. Then, She has
a fancy for making me do tricks. Almost
every day I must&mdash;&quot;Do the Fish, Toby
dear.&quot; She lifts me in her arms and squeezes
me until I gasp. My poor dumb mouth
opens as a carp's does when they're drowning
it in air....</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>That's <i>just</i> like Her!</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Suddenly I find myself free&mdash;and still
alive, miraculously saved by the power of
her will. How beautiful life seems to me
then! How fondly I lick the hand hanging
at her side, the hem of her dress!</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>contemptuously</i>)</p>

<p>A pretty thing to do!</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>All good and all evil come to me from
Her. She is my worst torment and my one
sure refuge. When I run to her, my heart
sick with fear, how soft her arms are
and how sweet her hair, falling in my face!
I'm her &quot;black-baby,&quot; her &quot;Toby-Dog,&quot;
her &quot;little bit o' love.&quot; She sits on the
ground to reassure me, making herself little
like me&mdash;lies down altogether and I go
wild with delight at the sight of her face
under mine, thrown back in her fragrant
hair. My feelings overflow, I can't resist
such a chance for a jolly good game. I
rummage and fumble about, excitedly poking
my nose everywhere, till I find the crispy
tip of a pink ear&mdash;Her ear. I nibble it
just enough to tickle her&mdash;to make her cry
out: &quot;Stop, Toby! That's awful! Help!
Help! This dog's devouring me!&quot;</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/041.gif" width="411" height="177" /></p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

H'm! Simple, homely, wholesome joys!
 ... And then, off you go to make friends
with the cook.

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>And you,&mdash;with the cat at the farm.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>coldly</i>)</p>

<p>Enough I pray, that concerns no one but
myself ... and the little cat.</p>

<!--<p><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/043.gif" width="429" height="969" /></p>-->

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>A pretty conquest! It should make you
blush&mdash;a seven-months-old kitten!</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>roused</i>)</p>

<p>For me she has all the charm of forbidden
fruit and no one dare steal her from me.
She is slim as a bean-pole....</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>aside</i>)</p>

<p>You old rascal!</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

... and long; poised on long legs she
walks with the uncertain step common to all
young things. She hunts field-mice, shrew-mice&mdash;even
partridge, and this hard work
in the fields has toughened her young muscles
and given a rather gloomy expression to her
kitten-face.

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>She's ugly.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>No, not ugly, but odd-looking. Her muzzle
with its very pink nostrils strongly resembles
that of a goat, her large ears remind
one of a peasant's coif, her eyes the
color of old gold are set slant-wise, and their
naturally keen expression is varied by an
occasional piquant squint.</p>

<p>With what a will does she fly me confounding
modesty with fear! I pass slowly
by (one would think me quite uninterested),
draped in my splendid coat. She's struck
by its stripes. Oh, she'll come back, a little
love-sick kitten, and putting aside all constraint
she'll throw herself at my feet&mdash;like
a supple white scarf&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>I've no objection, you know.... I'm
comparatively indifferent to all that concerns
love. Here my time's so completely filled ... physical exercise ... my cares of
watch-dog, I ... hardly give a thought to
the bagatelle.</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/044.gif" width="573" height="299" /></p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>aside</i>)</p>

<p>Bagatelle! ... He indulges in the persiflage
of a traveling salesman!</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>I love&mdash;Her and Him devotedly, with a
love that lifts me up to them. It suffices
to occupy my time and heart.</p>

<p>The hour of our siesta is passing, my
scornful friend. Do you know, I like you
in spite of your scorn and you like me, too.
Don't turn your head away, your peculiar
modesty would hide what you call frailty
and what I call love. Do you think me
blind? How often, on coming back to the
house with Her, have I seen your little triangular
face at the window, light up and
smile at my approach,&mdash;the time to open
the door and you'd already put on your cat's
mask&mdash;your pretty Japanesy mask, with
its narrow eyes.... Isn't it so?</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/045.gif" width="575" height="532" /></p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>resolved not to hear</i>)</p>

<p>The hour of the siesta is passing. The
cone-shaped shadows of the pear trees grow
long on the gravel path. We've talked away
our sleepiness. You've forgotten the flies,
your uneasy stomach, and the heat which
dances in waves on the meadows. The beautiful,
sultry day is dying. Already there's a
breeze bringing perfume from the pines.
Their trunks are melting into bright
tears....</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Here She is! She's left her wicker chair,
stretched her lovely arms and, judging from
the movement of her dress, I think we're going
to take a walk. See her behind the rosebushes?
Now, with her nails she breaks
a leaf from the lemon tree; she's crumpling
it up and smelling it. Ah ... I belong to
Her, soul and body. With my eyes closed I
can divine her presence.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Yes, I see Her. She is quiet and gentle
for the time being. He'll leave his paper
now to follow her. He'll come out calling,
&quot;Where are you?&quot; and sit on the bench,
tired out. For <i>him</i>, I shall rise politely,
and go &quot;do my nails&quot; along the leg of his
trousers. Silent, happy companions, we'll
listen for the day's departing footsteps.
The perfume of the lindens will become
sickeningly sweet at the same hour that my
seer's eyes grow big and black and read
mysterious Signs in the air.... Later on
a calm fire will be lit down there, behind the
pointed mountain&mdash;a circle of glistening
rose-color in the gray-blue of the night&mdash;a
sort of luminous cocoon from which will
burst the dazzling edge of the moon. She
will sail along, cleaving the clouds....
Then, it will be time to go to rest. He'll
carry me in on his shoulder and I'll sleep
close to his feet, which are ever mindful of
my repose.... Dawn will find me shivering
but rejuvenated, sitting face to the sun, in
a silvery halo of incense, offered me by the
dew. Thus, I am a perfect picture of the
god I was in the old, old days.</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/052.gif" width="553" height="270" /></p>


<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, TOBY-DOG, SHE <i>and</i> HE,
<i>have taken their places in a first-class
compartment. The train rolls along towards
distant mountains, and the freedom
of Summer-time</i>. TOBY, <i>on a leash, lifts
an inquiring nose to the window</i>. HE
<i>has strewn the carriage with newspapers</i>:
KIKI-THE-DEMURE, <i>silent and invisible in a
closed basket, is under his immediate protection</i>.
SHE, <i>leaning back against the
dusty cushions, dreams of the mountain
she loves best and of the low house on it,
weighted down with jasmine and virginia-creeper</i>.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>How fast this carriage goes! It can't be
our regular coachman. I haven't seen the
horses, but they smell very bad and make
black smoke. Oh, Silent Dreamer, look at me
and tell me&mdash;shall we arrive soon?</p>

<p>(<i>No response</i>. TOBY <i>gets
fidgety and blows through
his nostrils</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">SHE</p>

<p>Hush! Toby, hush!</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>I've hardly said a word.... Shall we
arrive soon?</p>

<p>(<i>He turns towards his master,
who is reading, and puts
a discreet paw on the edge
of his knee</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">HE</p>

<p>'Sh! ...</p>

<!--<img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/055a.gif" width="271" height="140" />-->

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>resigned</i>)</p>

<p>Hard luck! No one wants to talk to
me. I'm bored and what's more, I don't
know this carriage well enough. I'm tired
out. They woke me very early this morning.
I amused myself by running all over
the house. They had hidden the chairs
under sheets, wrapped up the lamps, rolled
up the rugs. Things were white and
changed and awful. There was a horrid
smell of camphor everywhere. My eyes
filled with water, I sneezed under the chairs
and slid on the bare floor in my haste to
follow the maids' white aprons. They
bustled about among trunks with such unwonted
zeal, that I was sure something exceptional
was going to happen.
<img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/055.gif" width="353" height="211" align="right" />
At the last
minute just as She came in, calling:
&quot;Toby's collar and the cat's basket!
Quick! put the cat in his basket!&quot;&mdash;just
as she was saying that, my chum disappeared.
It was indescribable! He, terrible
to see, swore by all the gods, and
struck the floor with his cane, furious because
they had allowed his Kiki to get away.
She called &quot;Kiki!&quot; at first supplicatingly,
then in threatening tones, and the maids
brought empty plates, meant to deceive, and
yellow paper from the butcher's. I really
thought my chum had left this world, when
suddenly&mdash;there he was perched on top
of the book-case, looking down on us with
an expression of contempt in his green eyes.
She put up her arms: &quot;Kiki <i>will</i> you
come down immediately! You are going to
make us lose the train!&quot; But he didn't come
down and it made me dizzy&mdash;though I was
on the ground&mdash;to see him way up there
walking and turning about and miauling
shrilly to tell us how impossible he found
it to obey. He was about frantic and
kept saying: &quot;Heavens, he's going to fall.&quot;
But She smiled skeptically, went out of the
room and came back armed with the whip.
The whip said, &quot;crack!&quot; twice only; then a
miracle happened I think, 'cause the cat
leaped to the floor, softer and more bouncey
than our plaything, the ball of wool. <i>I</i>
would have broken to pieces falling like
that! ... He has been in this basket ever
since.... (TOBY <i>goes to the basket</i>.)
Ah! here's a little peek-hole.... I see his
whiskers ... they're like white needles.
Whew! What eyes! (<i>He jumps back</i>.)
I'm rather afraid. One can't really shut a
cat up; he always manages to get out somehow.
 ... He must suffer, poor fellow!
Perhaps if I speak kindly to him ... (<i>he
calls very politely</i>) Cat!</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/056.gif" width="479" height="250" /></p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>spitting furiously</i>)</p>

<p>Khhh! ...</p>



<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>jumping back</i>)</p>

<p>Oh, you said a bad word! You look awful!
Have you a pain anywhere?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Go away! I'm a martyr.... Go away
I tell you, or I'll blow fire at you!</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>ingenuous</i>)</p>

<p>But why?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Why!--Because you're free, because I'm
in this basket, because the basket's in a foul
carriage which is shaking me to pieces, and
because the serenity of those two exasperates
me.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Would you like me to look out and tell
you what one sees from the carriage window?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Everything is equally odious to me.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>having looked out, comes back</i>)</p>

<p>I haven't seen anything....</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>bitterly</i>)</p>

<p>Thanks just the same.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>I mean I haven't seen anything that's
easy to describe. Some green things which
pass right close to us&mdash;so close and so fast
that they give one a slap in the eye. A flat
field turning 'round and 'round and over
there, a little pointed steeple&mdash;it's running
as fast as the carriage. Another field all
red with blossoming clover has just given
me another slap in the eye&mdash;a red slap.
The earth is sinking in&mdash;or else we're going
up, I'm not sure which. I see way off,
<i>far</i> away, some green lawns dotted with white
daisies&mdash;perhaps they're cows.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>with sarcasm</i>)</p>

<p>Or wafers, for sealing letters&mdash;or anything
you like.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Aren't you the least little bit amused?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>with a sinister laugh</i>)</p>

<p>Ha! Ask of the damned ...</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>more and more melodramatic,

humiliation, darkness, neglect&mdash;

<p>Hon! May this spongy, gray cloth soothe
my rage! ... Since morning, the whole

revolt. He whom I love, and who venerates
me, made not the least effort to defend me.
I've submitted to humiliating contacts, been
jolted to death, piercing whistles have shot
through my head from ear to ear. Ho, ho,
how good it is to relax the nerves and to
imagine that, with gleeful claws, one tears
the enemies' flesh in bloody shreds! Ho, ho!
S-c-r-a-t-c-h, and lift the paws on high!
Lift them high as possible! It's a supremely
insolent gesture....</p>

<p>I say, Kiki, when are you going to stop
that?</p>

<p class="center">HE, (<i>Indulgent and admiring</i>)</p>

<p>Let him alone. He's doing his nails.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>He has spoken for me. I forgive him.
But since it's allowed, I don't care any more
about tearing the cushions ... When will I
get out of this? Not that I'm afraid; they
are both there, and the dog too, with their
everyday faces ... I've twinges in my

me...</p>

<p class="center">SHE</p>

<p>Come now, we'll all have our luncheon.</p>

<p>(<i>She takes the things out of
the basket, crumples up
some tissue paper and
breaks a crisp brown roll</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>chewing</i>)</p>

<p>What She gave me then must have been
very good indeed to seem such a tiny bit.
It melted in my mouth, there's not even the

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>chewing</i>)</p>

<p>Breast of chicken! Purr-rr ... Goodness
me! I was purring without knowing it!
That won't do. They'll think me resigned
to this journey. I must eat slowly, grim,
and undeceived, eat for the sole purpose of
keeping myself alive...</p>

<p class="center">SHE, (<i>to the dog and cat</i>)</p>

<p>Allow me to have <i>my</i> luncheon now, if you
please. <i>I</i> too, like cold chicken and the
hearts of lettuce, dipped in salt...</p>

<p class="center">HE, (<i>anxiously</i>)</p>

<p>What <i>shall</i> we do to make this cat go into
his basket again?</p>

<p class="center">SHE</p>

<p>I don't know. We'll see presently...</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Finished already? I could swallow three
times that much. I say Cat, you're eating
rather well for a martyr.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>fibbing</i>)</p>

<p>Trouble digs a hole in one's interior.
Move away please, I want to sleep now ...
if I can. Perhaps a merciful dream will
take me back to the house I've left, to the
flowered cushion He gave me.... Home!
sweet home! Rugs of bright colors for the
delight of my eyes, a palm with nice shoots
for me to eat, deep arm-chairs, under
which I hide my woolen ball as a future surprise
for myself&mdash;ah, and the cork hanging
by a string to the door-latch! the tables
covered with bibelots! I thread my way
in and out among them and occasionally
it amuses me to break some brittle thing.
The dining-room is a temple! The vestibule,
full of mystery; there unseen, I can
watch those who come and go ... Oh narrow
back-stairway, where the step of the
milkman rings out for me like a morning
angelus&mdash;farewell! farewell! my destiny
carries me on, and who knows if ever ...
But this is <i>too</i> sad! All the pretty things
I've been saying have really begun to make
me feel badly!!</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/068.gif" width="438" height="295" /></p>

<p>(<i>He begins a minute and

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>There it is again! An acci&mdash;Oh
bother, I've had enough of that!</p>

<p class="center">HE, (<i>anxiously</i>)</p>

<p>We're going to change trains in ten minutes.
How about the cat? He'll never allow
us to shut him up...</p>

<p class="center">SHE</p>

<p>We'll see ... Suppose we put some meat
in his basket?</p>

<p class="center">HE</p>

<p>Or perhaps petting would...</p>

<p>(<i>They approach the redoubtable</i>
KIKI <i>and both speak
together</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">HE</p>

<p>Kiki, my beautiful Kiki, come jump on my
knee, or on my shoulder. You like that
as a rule. You'll doze there and then I'll
put you gently into the basket. After all,
it's open-work and has a comfortable cushion
to protect you from the rough wicker.
Come, my dear....</p>

<p class="center">SHE</p>

<p>Listen, Kiki. You must learn to act
properly and to take life as it is. You can't
stay there like that. We're going to change
trains and a horrible guard will appear and
say insulting things of you and your race.
Besides you'd better obey, because if you
don't, I&mdash;I'll give you a good whipping.</p>

<p>(<i>But before she can lift her hand
against his sacred fur, Kiki gets up,
stretches himself, arches his back, yawns,&mdash;to
show the rosy lining of his mouth,

of quiet insolence. He and She exchange
eloquent glances</i>.)</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/074.gif" width="587" height="244" /></p>

<p><i>A parlor, in the country, at the close of a
long summer's day</i>. KIKI-THE-DEMURE
<i>and</i> TOBY-DOG <i>doze; ears twitching and
eyelids obstinately shut. Now</i> KIKI'S <i>lids
part in a narrow slit, and disclose eyes the
color of purple grapes. He yawns, with
the ferocious expression of a small
dragon.</i></p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>haughtily</i>)</p>

<p>You're snoring!</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>who was not really asleep</i>)</p>

<p>I'm not; it's you.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Impossible! I don't snore, I purr.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Same thing.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>not condescending to a
discussion</i>)</p>

<p>Thank heaven, it isn't! (<i>A silence</i>.)</p>

<p>I'm hungry. One doesn't hear the noise
of plates in the next room. Isn't it dinner
time?</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>gets up, slowly stretches his
forepaws and yawns, darting forth a
heraldic tongue with curly end</i>)</p>

<p>I don't know ... I'm hungry.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Where is She? How is it you're not at
her heels?</p>



<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>embarrassed, nibbling his nails</i>)</p>

<p>She's in the garden I believe, picking up
plums.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Those yellow balls that rain about one's
ears? I know them. You've seen her then?
I bet She scolded you ... What have you
been doing now?</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>self-conscious, turning away his
wrinkled, toad-like face</i>)</p>

<p>She told me to return to the house because&mdash;because
I too, was eating plums.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>She did well! You have depraved tastes&mdash;the
tastes of men.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>offended</i>)</p>

<p>Say&mdash;no one ever sees me eating bad
fish! And never, <i>never</i> will I understand how
you can go into such fits over a dead frog,
or that herb.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Valerian.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>That's it, I guess ... An herb&mdash;is medicine,
isn't it?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Medicine, indeed! Valerian ... but no
<i>you</i>, can't understand ... I've seen Her
laugh and go on, as I do over the valerian,
after having emptied a glass of fetid wine
that jumped dangerously too. As for the
dead frog&mdash;so dead that it seems a bit of
dry russia leather in the form of a frog&mdash;it's
a sachet, impregnated with rare musk,
with which I wish to scent my fur.</p>

<p><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/077.gif" width="327" height="231" /></p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Oh, you talk very well&mdash;but She always
scolds and says that you smell bad after it,
and He says the same thing.</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/078.gif" width="572" height="960" /></p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>They're nothing but Two-Paws, both of
them. You, poor thing, belittle yourself
by seeking to imitate them. You stand on
your hind legs, wear a coat when it rains,
eat plums&mdash;for shame!--and those big
green balls, the malicious trees let fall sometimes,
when I'm passing underneath.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Apples?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Very likely. She picks one up and
throws it down the path, crying: &quot;Apple,
Toby, apple,&quot; and you rush after, in unseemly
fashion, gasping for breath, looking
like a fool, your tongue and your eyes sticking
out ...</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>scowling, head resting on his
paws</i>)</p>

<p>One takes one's pleasures where one finds
them.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>yawning, shows his
pointed teeth and his palate of pink velvet</i>)</p>

<p>I'm hungry. Dinner is surely late tonight.
Suppose you look for Her?</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>I daren't. She forbade it. She is down
there in the hollow, with a big basket. The
dew is falling and wetting her feet and the
sun's going away. But you know how She is.
She sits on the damp ground, looking ahead
of her, as if She were asleep&mdash;or lies flat on
her stomach, whistling and watching an
ant in the grass ... She tears up a handful
of wild thyme and smells it, or calls the
tomtits and the jays&mdash;who never come to
her by any chance. She takes a heavy
watering pot and&mdash;ugh! it gives me the
shivers&mdash;pours thousands of icy, silvery
threads over the roses or into the hollows
of those little stone troughs, 'way back in
the woods. I always look in to see the
head of a brindle-bull who comes to meet
me and to drink up the pictures of the
leaves, but She pulls me back by the collar
with: &quot;Toby, Toby, <i>that</i> water is for the
birds.&quot; ... Then She takes out her knife
and opens nuts, fifty, a <i>hundred</i> nuts, and
forgets the time ... There's no end to the
things She does.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>slyly</i>)</p>

<p>And what do you do all that time?</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>I&mdash;well&mdash;I just wait for her.</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" src="gifs/081a.gif" width="521" height="287" alt=" " /></p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>I admire you!</p>

<p class="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Once in a while, squatting down, She
eagerly scratches the earth, toils and sweats
over it; then I jump 'round her, delighted
to see her at something so useful and so
familiar. But her feeble scent deceives her.
<i>I</i> never smell mole, or shrew-mouse-of-the-rosy-paws,
in the holes <i>She</i> digs. And how
explain her utter lack of purpose? Presently,
falling back on her haunches, She
brandishes a hairy-rooted herb and cries:
&quot;I have it, the jade!&quot; I lie in the damp
grass and tremble, or dig my nose
(She calls it my snout) into the earth
to get the complicated odors of it. ... When there are three or four
scents all blended, all mixed together,
can you distinguish that of the
mole from that of the hare which passed
quickly, or the bird which rested there?</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" src="gifs/081b.gif" width="551" height="433" alt=" " /></p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" src="gifs/082a.gif" width="570" height="303" alt=" " /></p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Certainly I can. My nose is highly educated.
It's small, regular, wide between
my eyes, delicate at the chamois-skin end
of my nostrils; the lightest touch of a blade
of grass, the shadow of smoke tickles and
makes it sneeze. It doesn't bother about
distinguishing the scent of moles from that
of&mdash;hares, did you say? But it delights
in the trace left by a cat in a hedge ... I've
a charming nose. She calls it, &quot;his pretty
little nose of cotton velvet.&quot; Since my eyes
opened on this world I've not known the day
that someone has not uttered a truthful flattery
on the subject of my nose. Now yours&mdash;is
a rough-grained truffle. What makes
you move it so ridiculously? At this very
moment.</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/082b.gif" width="550" height="301" /></p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>I'm hungry and I don't hear the plates.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

... your truffle of a nose works up and
down and makes another wrinkle in your
irregular mug.

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>She always says, &quot;his square muzzle, his
wrinkled truffle,&quot; so tenderly and so lovingly!</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

... And you think of nothing but eating.

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>It's <i>your</i> empty stomach that scolds and
complains and wants to quarrel with me.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>I've a charming stomach.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>But no, it's your nose that's charming.
You just said so.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>My stomach too. There's none more fastidious,
more whimsical, stronger and at the
same time more delicate. It digests the
bones of sole, but meat that's the least bit
tainted literally turns it.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Literally's the word. You have <i>active</i>
indigestion.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Yes, the whole house is affected by it.
From the very first qualms I'm in terrible
distress; the earth gives way under me, my
eyes dilate, I hurriedly swallow quantities
of salty saliva; involuntary, ventriloquial
cries escape me, my sides bulge out&mdash;</p>

<!--<p><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/085.gif" width="327" height="100" /></p>-->

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>disgusted</i>)</p>

<p>I say, if it's all the same to you, tell me
the rest after dinner.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>I'm hungry. Where can He be?</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>He's there, in his study, scratching paper.</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/086.gif" width="530" height="241" /></p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>He's always doing that. It's a game.
Two-Paws play at the same thing for hours
and hours. I've often tried to scratch
paper gently, as He does, but the pleasure
doesn't last long. I prefer newspapers torn
into shreds that rustle and fly ... There is
a little pot of dark-violet, muddy water on
his table. I never sniff it without horror,
since the day a rather foolish curiosity made
me dip my paw into it. This very paw, so
strong and aristocratic, (the tufts of useless
hair you see between my toes proclaim the
purity of my race) this very paw bore a
bluish stain for eight days and the degrading
odor of rusty steel clung to it a long time
after ...</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>What's the little pot for?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>He drinks from it doubtless.</p>

<p>(<i>Silence</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>She's not back yet! Heaven grant She
isn't lost, as I was one day in the streets of
Paris!</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>I'm hungry!</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>I'm hungry! What are we going to eat
this evening?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>I saw a chicken. It made a silly noise
and dropped red blood on the kitchen floor,
soiling it far more than I ever did, or you
either&mdash;yet no one whipped it. But Emily
put it in the fire, to teach it a lesson. I
licked up some of the blood ...</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>yawns</i>)</p>

<p>Chicken ... it makes my mouth water.
She'll say: &quot;Here Toby, bones!&quot; and
throw me the carcass.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>How badly you speak! He says: &quot;Little
chicken bones, Kiki, little chicken bones!&quot;</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>surprised</i>)</p>

<p>But no <i>really</i> it's, &quot;Here, Toby, bones!&quot;
that She says.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>He speaks better than She does.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>incompetent</i>)</p>

<p>Ah? ... Tell me, do birds taste anything
like chicken?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>whose eyes light up
suddenly</i>)</p>

<p>No ... they're far better, they're alive.
Ha, the quivering bird, the warm feathers,
the delicious little brain ... you feel it all
crackling between your teeth!</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Oh, you make me sick! It always worries
me to see tiny animals like that flutter about
... and birds are dear, good little things.

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>dryly</i>)</p>

<p>Don't you believe it, they're only good
to eat. They're noisy, stupid creatures, infatuated
with themselves, <i>made</i> to be eaten.
 ... You know the two jays?

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Not very well.</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/089a.gif" width="491" height="226" /></p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>They live in the little wood. When I
walk by they laugh a sardonic &quot;tiac, tiac,&quot;
because I wear a bell at my neck. In vain
do I hold my head very stiffly and put my
paws down <i>very</i> gently, my bell tinkles and
the two creatures scream from the top of the
fir-tree. Just let me get hold of them, one
of these days! ...</p>

<p>(<i>He lays back his ears and
raises the hair along his
back</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>pensive</i>)</p>

<p>Positively, Cat, there are times when I
don't know you. We are talking quietly and
suddenly you bristle like a bottle-brush;
or we happen to be playing amicably together
and I bark behind your back&mdash;bow,
wow-wow!--just for fun; then,&mdash;one
doesn't know why, perhaps because my nose
has grazed the long hairs on your legs you're
so proud of&mdash;you become all at once a savage
beast, spitting fire, and charging at me
like a strange dog. Don't you think that
shows a bad character?</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/090.gif" width="567" height="238" /></p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>mysterious, eyes half-closed</i>)</p>

<p>Not at all. It's character, simply. A
Cat's character. In such moments of irritability,
I'm keenly alive to the humiliation
of my present state, and that of my race.</p>

<p>I can remember a time when priests in
long, linen tunics, bending low, spoke to us
and humbly tried to comprehend our chanted
utterance. Know, dog, that it is not <i>we</i> who
have changed! It may be, there are days
when I'm more myself, when everything offends
me, and justly; a brusque gesture, a
vulgar laugh, the banging of a door, your
odor, your inconceivable impudence when
you touch me, or encircle me, jumping and
yelping ...</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/091.gif" width="507" height="180" /></p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>patiently, to himself</i>)</p>

<p>He's having one of his attacks.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>with a start</i>)</p>

<p>Did you hear?</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Yes, the kitchen door, and the door into
the dining-room ... and now the drawer
where the spoons are kept. At last! At
last! aaah! (<i>He yawns</i>.) I can't stand
this any longer. <i>Where</i> is She? I don't
hear the gravel creaking ... night's coming
on!</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>ironically</i>)</p>

<p>Go find her.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>And how about Him? He usually worries,
and comes in asking, &quot;Where is She?&quot;
But He's scratching still. He must have
drunk up all the violet-colored water in the
muddy little pot by this time. (TOBY <i>carefully
stretches his legs</i>.) Ah! I feel lively
 ... and empty. We're going to eat soon!
Just smell the good kitchen-smells that come
under the door! ... Let's play!</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

carve the chicken very quickly, won't you,

<p>He said, &quot;'Sh!&quot; <i>I'm</i> not making any noise.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>ironically</i>)</p>

<p>They're astonishing! They say &quot;no

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Some truth in that. (<i>He looks at the

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>What's that?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Nothing. An Oriental proverb. If I
wished, dog, to disturb the silence of this
room I'd be clever enough to choose a rickety
chair; its feet would pound out a regular
tic-toc, tic-toc, tic-toc, in time with my
tongue as I washed myself. It's a means
I've invented to gain my liberty. Tic-toc,
tic-toc, says the chair. She happens to be
reading or writing, is easily irritated, and
cries, &quot;Be quiet, Kiki!&quot; But I go on unconscious
of any wrong-doing; tic-toc, tic-toc.
She jumps up distracted and opens
the door wide for me: slowly, like one exiled, I
cross its threshold and once outside, laugh
to find myself so superior to them all.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>who hasn't been listening,
yawns</i>)</p>

<p>What a sad week, eh? I don't know what
it is to take a walk any more. I haven't
taken any pleasure in eating either, since She
fell from her horse.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Heavens, one can love people and care for
one's stomach too.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>with ardor</i>)</p>

<p>Not I! When She screamed and fell from
her horse, I felt the heart crack inside me.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>That affair couldn't have ended otherwise.
One doesn't go climbing up on a horse! People
don't do such things! I see nothing but
extravagance around me. To begin
with, a horse is a fearful monstrosity.</p>

<p>I happen to have had the opportunity of
making a very close study of one....</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>aside</i>)</p>

<p>He makes me laugh!</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

... It was the farmer's horse that grazed
in the meadow. My life, for a whole month,
was embittered by that roving mountain.
Lying under the hedge, I could see his heavy
feet disfiguring the ground. I breathed his
vulgar odor and heard his strident cry shaking
the air. Once when he was eating the
lower twigs of the hedge, I saw myself&mdash;the
whole of me&mdash;reflected in one of his
eyes! I fled ... and from that day my hatred
was so strong that I wildly hoped to
annihilate the monster. I'll go up to him,
thought I, I'll plant myself firmly in front
of him, and the desire of his death will be
so strong in my eyes, that perhaps, he'll die
when he meets my look...

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>diverted</i>)</p>

<p>And then?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>continuing</i>)</p>

<p>I carried out my plan. But the horse I
had waited for in fear and trembling, just
blew through his nostrils a long jet of foul-smelling
vapor, and <i>I</i> fell back in atrocious
convulsions.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>Inwardly writhing with laughter</i>)</p>

<p>You don't exaggerate?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>serious</i>)</p>

<p>Never! And She must needs go climbing
on a horse's back, holding fast to four
cords, one leg this side and the other that. ... Strange aberration!

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>We don't think alike, Cat. For me, the
horse is, after man, the most beautiful thing
in the world.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>vexed</i>)</p>

<p>And where do I come in?</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>evasive and courteous</i>)</p>

<p><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/106.gif" width="188" height="212" align="right" /></p>

<p>Oh, you're a <i>Cat</i>. But a horse, and with
Her on his back! What a beautiful picture
they make, high up in the blue air!
To gaze on it, I have to throw my head 'way
back on my thick neck. The horse lends
her his speed. Now at last, She can race
with me when I go off on a mad run. Sometimes
I'm ahead, ears floating back and
tongue hanging out like a little flag&mdash;the
angular shadow of the horse on the road in
front. If I follow her, a fragrant dust
blows back at me. It smells of warm leather,
moist beast, and a little of her own perfume
too. The road runs under me, like a
ribbon that someone is pulling. Oh, what
joy it is to be so little and so swift, running
along in the shadow of a great galloping
horse! When we halt, I pant like a motor,
between the legs of my friend, who snorts
and in the kindliest way puts down his fettered
mouth and sprinkles me ...</p>

<p><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/107.gif" width="527" height="510" /></p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>I know, I know! The horse &quot;with long
mane ashake; hoofs, heavy with tumult;
eyes, glimmering white.&quot; ...You are the
last of the Romanticists.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>I'm not the last of the Romanticists. I'm
a little bull-dog that came into the world
one evening, almost under the feet of a chestnut
mare. She didn't lie down all night
long, she was so afraid of crushing my
mother and her puppies. A little bull-dog
like me is almost the child of a horse. I lay
in the warm straw against her warm flanks,
I drank out of the stable pails. I used to
get up when I heard the sound of hoofs
coming in and I took an interest in the
washing of the carriages, until the day
She came and picked me out&mdash;<i>me</i>, the best-looking,
the most snub-nosed, the stockiest of
the litter. (<i>Sighing</i>.) And there She lies,
so dreadfully quiet! It makes me sad to see
her with that little cloth still 'round her
ankle. You remember when He picked her
up in his arms? He held her&mdash;and She's a
lot bigger than I am&mdash;just as if She were
a little dog that he was going to drown....</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/108.gif" width="273" height="245" /></p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>bitterly</i>)</p>

<p>I remember. I was at the top of the
stairs irritated by the noise, but curious.
He came up and pushed me aside with his
foot, as he would have done if a piece of
furniture had happened to be in his way.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Is that why you stayed away from this
room&mdash;her room&mdash;for three whole days?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>hesitating</i>)</p>

<p>Yes ... and for another reason too.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>What reason?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Because of the fever.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>carried away by his love</i>)</p>

<p>Her fever smells better than other peoples'
good health!</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>shrugging his shoulders</i>)</p>

<p>And they talk of a dog's scent! Truly
the convictions of Two-Paws are based upon
childish fables. You know of course that
fever&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>in a low tone</i>)</p>

<p>Makes one afraid, yes.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>in a low tone</i>)</p>

<p>Makes one afraid, gives one cold shivers
down one's back, distaste for everything and
uneasiness all over. One hesitates on the
threshold of a room where there is fever,
searching fearfully some hidden thing....
She was in bed and burning hot. I looked at
her a long time, ready to run, saying to myself:
&quot;Who can be with her there&mdash;behind
the curtains&mdash;who is it stifles and torments
her and makes her moan in her sleep?&quot;</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>frightened retrospectively</i>)</p>

<p>There wasn't anyone, was there?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>No one but He&mdash;and the fever. He, the
most intelligent of Two-Paws, was leaning
over her listening to her breathing, dimly
aware of an invisible presence. I overcame
my aversion and looked at her. I was melancholy
and jealous. He must love her,
thought I, to go so near and defend her,
to kiss her, imbued as She is with the evil
charm. Would He hold me to his heart, if
I&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>imperatively</i>)</p>

<p>'Sh!</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/112.gif" width="574" height="246" /></p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>alert, looking at her</i>)</p>

<p>No ... She didn't stir, but her thoughts
did. I felt them. Continue.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>who has recovered his
equanimity</i>)</p>

<p>I don't know now what we were talking
about.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>The fev&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>quickly</i>)</p>

<p>Enough. Don't recall it. Fever is the
beginning of the thing one never speaks of.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>shivering</i>)</p>

<p>Yes, I know.... I don't like an animal
that can't move. You know what I mean ...</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>laughing cruelly</i>)</p>

<p>Nor do I. I can only eat live birds, and
as for the tiny mice, I prefer to swallow
them, squeak and all ...</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Why does it amuse you to horrify me?
You've a certain vanity that I can't understand.
It consists in exaggerating cruelties
that are already real enough. You call me
the last of the Romanticists, aren't you the
first of the Sadics?</p>

<p><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/113.gif" width="236" height="368" /></p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Oh dog, poisoned with literature! An
eternal misunderstanding separates us.
&quot;I'm a little bull-dog,&quot; you replied just now,
with that stupid sincerity which disarms me.
Let me say to you in my turn, &quot;I am a
Cat.&quot; The name is sufficient dispensation.
There is in me a hatred of pain and ugliness,
an overmastering detestation of all
that offends my sight, or my reason. When
the concierge's cat dragged around his
wounded paw, I threw myself upon him, fired
by a righteous anger, and until he stopped
his whining I&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>supplicatingly</i>)</p>

<p>Don't tell me!</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>getting angry</i>)</p>

<p>Understand then, once and for all&mdash;if
the pale recital of what I did upsets you&mdash;that
I wished to abolish, to annihilate in that
bleeding animal the suggestion of my own
inevitable death ...</p>

<p>(<i>They are quiet for a little
while</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>shuddering</i>)</p>

<p>This confinement does us no good. I
would gladly go out into the soft sunshine
and do &quot;the bayadeer's dance,&quot; as He
calls it, on the dry gravel among the leaves,
which look like fried potatoes. Everything
is yellow out-of-doors. My green eyes would
reflect the golden sun and the flaming woods
and so turn yellow too. ... Now I'll think
only of what is joyous and yellow, the beautiful,
cold Autumn, the rosy dawn that leaves
its colors in the foliage of the cherry-tree
 ... Come, let's prove the strength of our
legs and enjoy to the full the consciousness
that youth has only just begun for us ...
Who knows, death may never come ...</p>

<p>Oh Fire, how splendid you are! You
have come back more beautiful than my

than the sun! The pupils of my eyes contract
in your light, their lids half close,
modestly hiding the joy I feel at seeing you
again, and my inscrutable countenance shows
but the semblance of a thought painted there
in fawn color and black.... Your crackling
drowns the soft sound of my purr. Don't

I am still very young, but I remember how

woke you in this same chimney-place. The
sight of a god as mysterious as you are
was most impressive to a baby-dog just out
of the maternal stable. Oh Fire, I've not

spit at me, something red that smarts ...

turns away</i>.) Nothing is ever perfect. The
east wind coming under the door nips my
hind-legs. Well, it can't be helped! I'll
freeze behind if I must, provided I can adore
you face to face.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>I am a Cat and therefore aware of all
that you bring in your train, O Fire! I
foresee winter; its coming both troubles and
pleases me. I've already begun to thicken
and embellish my fur-coat in its honor, the
darker stripes are becoming black, my white
tippet swells into a dazzling boa, and the fur
on my belly surpasses in beauty anything
that has ever been seen. What shall I say
of my tail, broad as a club, with alternate
rings of fawn-color and black, or of the sensitive,
priceless aigrettes which spring from
my ears? My ear-rings She calls them....
What cat could resist me! Ah! the January
nights, the serenades under a frosty
moon, the dignified wait on the pinnacle
of a roof, the encounter with a rival cat on
the narrow top of a wall!... But I feel
quite sure of my superior strength. I'll
swish my tail, put back my ears, sniff tragically
as one does before vomiting, and then lift
up my voice&mdash;its modulations are infinite.
I'll make it strong enough to waken all the
sleeping Two-Paws. I'll vociferate, I'll
whimper, pacing up and down the garden,
my body distended, my legs bent outward,
feigning madness to terrify the tom-cats!</p>

<p><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/127.gif" width="550" height="383" /></p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>I know something of the changes and
pleasures you foretell, Fire&mdash;for I'm a Dog.
Already, it is raining in the garden. I suppose
it's raining on the road too, and in
the woods. The falling drops are not warm,
as they were in the summer storms when my
truffle, gray with dust, delighted in the
damp smell that came from the west. The
sky is troubled and the wind has grown
strong enough to blow my ears out straight,
like little flags. A sharp cry, such as I
make when I beg, comes under the door.
You'll be shining here every day, Fire; but
I'll have to suffer for the right to worship
you. For She'll continue to wander about,
her head covered with the pointed hood which
changes her so, that it frightens me. She'll
put on wooden shoes too, and carelessly
crush the puddles, the little heaps of mud,
and the weeping mosses. I'll follow her,
since I've promised to do so my life long
(and also because I can't help it), I'll follow
her, a forlorn and piteous object, shining
wet, my belly covered with mud, until,
through very excess of misery I'll forget,
and ramble in the coppice, interested in
every undulation of the grass, eager to revive
the drowned scents in it.... She'll become
communicative when she sees me hurrying
along and we'll talk: &quot;Ha, Toby-Dog,&quot;
she'll say, &quot;ha! ha! a bird! There on
the branch! Look! you booby! Now he's
gone.&quot; She'll condole with me then, until
I'm on the verge of tears. &quot;Oh, my little
black boy, my sympathetic cylinder, my
batrachian love, how cold you are, how wet,
how sad, how you suffer, oooo!&quot; And before
I'm able to judge of the sincerity of her
pity, the tears will overflow, my throat contract,
and we'll wail in unison....</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/128.gif" width="536" height="227" /></p>

<p>Ah, but what delirious joy when the capricious
wooden shoes turn again toward the
house, hurrying to rejoin Him whom we've
left scratching paper! They don't go half
fast enough for me then! I jump 'round
her, barking with delight to see the hill diminishing,
our climb at an end, to smell the
good stable smell and that of burning wood
as we near the house. At last you shine
forth, O Fire, O Sun, through the misty window
pane!... I shall hardly have crossed
the threshold when an overpowering sleepiness
will dash me to the floor in front of
you&mdash;you, who will reduce the mud on my
belly to fine powder and change the water of
the roads to smoky vapor.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>A delightful glow penetrates my coat to
the silky down, the impalpable colorless
threads which protect my delicate skin. I
feel myself swelling like a cloud. I must
quite fill the room. My whiskers seem
charged with electricity&mdash;a sign that I will
sleep&mdash;but for the time being, the contemplation
of your splendor and thoughts of the
coming season keep me awake. It's raining.
I shall not go out. I'll wait for the sun, or
the dry wind, or better still, the frost. Ah,
how the biting cold stimulates me! It lashes
my lungs with handfuls of needles, and makes
a <i>bonbon glac&eacute;</i> of my charming nose. The
rollicking frost-sprite will blow his madness
into me. She'll laugh and He too,
leaving his scratching-paper, to see me vie
with the leaves in bounds, leaps and wild
whirlings, resembling a floating flurry of
gray smoke rather than a Cat. To the top
of a tree! Down again! Then seven turns
after my tail! A perilous backward leap!
A vertical jump, with aerial <i>danse du ventre</i>!
Girations, sneezes, careering from the real
to the dream, until in terror of myself, I
come to a sudden stop.... Everything
turns before my eyes. I'm the center of a
strange, spinning world ... In my bewilderment
(half-feigned) I'll make a little moo,
like a cow, which will bring them both running
to me,&mdash;She laughing, and He fearing
something wrong. That will suffice to sober
me, and with a bold front and noble mien, I'll
regain this cushion near your altar, O Fire!</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>


<p>This hearth-stone burns the horny pads of
my feet. What shall I do? Move away?
never! I'll toast to death rather than give
up this redoubtable bliss. Heaven prevent
Her coming, now! I've reason to fear the lash
of the whip, and the magic words which mean
exile: &quot;Toby! that's stupid! I forbid you
to roast yourself. You'll have sore eyes,
and catch cold when you go out.&quot; That's
what She says, while I regard her with a
stupid look of utter devotion. But She's
never duped by it. I hear noises upstairs,
her step coming and going ... I wonder is
her vagabond fancy wearied at last?
<img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/133.gif" width="513" height="263" align="left"/>
This
morning She whistled to me and in my haste
to obey her, I rolled to the bottom of the
stairs&mdash;being low and thick-set, with short
legs, no nose, and almost no tail to balance
me. Well, we set off. The last apples were
rocking to-and-fro on swaying branches.
My happy voice, a joyful shout from her now
and then, the vain crowing of the cocks, the
creaking of wagons on the road&mdash;all these
sounds floated on a bluish, cottony, suffocating
fog. She took me far, and many
marvelous things happened on our way. We
met terrible giant dogs. My proud bearing
seemed to exasperate them, but I kept
them back with a single look (besides, a
closed iron gate rendered them powerless).
I chased a rabbit into the thicket, though
She cried loudly: &quot;I forbid you to touch
the little animal!&quot; ... My mother certainly
gave me swift legs but they're short,
and the white end of the little beast kept far
ahead. A bush covered with red berries detained
us a very long time. She sees no objection
to eating strange things and I can
truthfully say that I always taste everything
She offers me, for I've great faith in her.
But this morning&mdash;&quot;Eat, Toby, nice berries.
Eat! here are some rose-hips. Oh
stupid! how can you not dote upon their
delicious flavor? I assure you these are
comfits of Mother Nature's making.&quot; In
deference to her, I chewed a reddish ball;
there were some rough hairs on it&mdash;put
there doubtless by her teasing hand&mdash;and
what was bound to happen, did happen ... Khaha!
My throat rejected the nasty &quot;rosehip.&quot;...</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/134.gif" width="557" height="156" /></p>

<p>But listen, Fire, what I saw after that,
passes <i>my</i> understanding. It was in a wood
where stiff leaves rustled. Had She carried
you under her cloak, or do gods like
you come at her bidding? I saw her hands
pile up the wood, arrange flat stones in some
mysterious fashion, and then, Fire, I saw
the sparks flash and your joyous soul palpitate,
grow big, soar naked and rose-colored,
veil itself in smoke, snap noisily (for
yours is a belligerent soul), agonize&mdash;and
disappear.... The world is full of incomprehensible
things....</p>

<p>Last of all, on our way back, I discovered
near the park gate&mdash;saw it before She
did&mdash;one of those invincible beasts called
hedge-hogs, the mere sight of which brings
us dogs to bay. What madness to realize
that an animal is hiding under that pin-cushion
and laughing at me, and that I can
do nothing, <i>nothing</i>! I implored her&mdash;She
can do nearly everything&mdash;to pluck
him for me. She began by turning him
over with a little stick, as if he were a horse
chestnut. &quot;Astonishing,&quot; said She, &quot;I
can't find the top of him!&quot; Then She took
one of his spines between two fingers and
carried him home that way&mdash;I dancing behind
her&mdash;and put him in her work basket.
After a while the horrid beast unrolled himself,
stuck out a pig-like nose, opened two
shiny rat's eyes and raised himself, holding
fast by his little paws, which were exactly
like a mole's. &quot;How pretty he is,&quot;
She cried, &quot;a real little black pig.&quot; I
stood near the table groaning with covetousness,
but She didn't pluck him for me,
not then, or ever, and perhaps the cook ate
him.... This cat's a dissembler. Maybe
<i>he</i>... But away with care! I'm too excitable!
I mustn't let myself think of these
things. Life is beautiful, O Fire, since you
illumine it ... I'm going to sleep ... Watch
over my unconscious body ... I'm
going ... to sleep....</p>

<p>One would think me asleep because the
narrow slit made by my parted eyelids,
seems but the continuation of that velvety
line, that bold crayon-stroke, a sort of
Oriental make-up, uniting my eyelids and my
ears. But I'm awake, keeping watch like
a yogi, in a state of blissful ankylosis, conscious
of all that's going on around me....
My privileged eyes, Fire, do but behold you
better when they're closed and I can count
the various essences you mingle in a sparkling
bouquet. Here in a flame of mauve-color
and blue, glows the soul of a branch
of arbor-vitae. Yesterday it waved a
plume-like shadow on the garden walk ... To-day,
with its delicate twigs, it is but a
writhing skeleton. She cut it with one stroke
of the pruning scissors. Why? That it
might breathe out its fervent blue and
mauve-colored soul? For like me, She delights
in your dance, Fire, and chastises
you when you're quiet, with a stern pair of
tongs. Sitting there with her head bent
and her arms hanging along her sides, what
does She read, I wonder, in that fiery rose
which is the labyrinthian heart of you?...
She knows a great deal certainly, but not as
much as a Cat.</p>

<p>That thick tear on the log represents the
anguish of a very old fir-tree, killed by the
assiduous ivy. Just a short time ago I saw
it struck down, lying on the grass, its foliage
looking like a beautiful head of reddish
hair. I saw the axe that felled it, too.
Its trunk weeps tears of resin, which trail
along in drivel, then change to heavy, creeping
flame. But the dry red locks break into
lines of living fire, whistle and shoot innumerable
jets of many colors underneath a
broad gold wave that rolls voluptuously....</p>

<!--<p><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/139.gif" width="416" height="313" /></p>-->

<p>Ah, love ... hunting ... fighting.... It's
your light, Fire, that discovers these passions
in the depths of my being. It's time
the little winged creatures searching withered
berries came near. I'll have them
soon! I'll watch, motionless in the brushwood,
wildly wishing that the earth itself
might hide me, the muscles of my legs twitching
with desire to make the spring, my chin
trembling.... Then, if I don't betray my
hiding-place by an irrepressible quavering,
frightening them away in one great commotion
of wings and rustling branches!...
But no, I'm master of myself. One bound at
exactly the right moment and my feeble
prey is panting under me. Oh, the ridiculous
effort of a weak animal&mdash;its tiny ineffectual
claws and pointed wings beating
against my face! My jaws will open to the
splitting point and my perfect nose wrinkle
ferociously, for the joy of holding a living,
terrified body. I'll know the intoxication of
battle! I'll prance victoriously, shaking my
head to torment the bird a little, for it
faints away too soon between my teeth!
Terrible to see I'll gallop towards the house,
singing in a strangled voice, without loosening
my grip, for He must stop his scratching
to admire me, and She must give chase with
distracted cries: &quot;Wicked, savage cat!
Drop that bird! drop that bird!! Oh, I beg
of you! It hurts me so....&quot; Ha! She
never can have hunted....</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/140.gif" width="398" height="172" /></p>

<p>I intend to astonish the world, Fire, during
Winter's reign. The Cat that lives at
the farm (She says the farmer's cat,
while we say the Cat's farmer), the fellow
that's so badly dressed, disfigured by the
nose of a weasel, and seems to walk on
stilts, his legs are so long&mdash;well, he sharpens
his claws and regards me the while.
Patience! He's strong, brutal, irresolute,
and utterly lacks distinction. The slamming
of a door terrifies him; he puts back
his ears and flies, panic-stricken. Still, I've
seen him kill a good-sized hen, without making
any fuss about it. For a glance of the
young cat's deceitful eyes, or right of precedence
on the garden wall, for a word of
double meaning, for nothing, but the fun
of the thing&mdash;I'll take my chances with
him! He'll learn that a mysterious silence
can demoralize the enemy quite as effectively
as murderous cries. The low garden wall
seems to me a convenient place. Let him
try his hoarse miauling in all possible keys!
May his unsightly face, and more hideous
body dislocate itself in a deceitful ataxia
(for they're still at these old tricks)! I'll
be proof against it all, and merely flash
the green magnetism of my magnificent eyes
upon him. His brows will fall under
their persistent insult, a shudder will run
along his spine, he'll do a few steps of
our ancient war dance&mdash;forward, back, forward
again. But I'll stand&mdash;motionless
as the statue of a Cat. The green witchcraft
of my gaze will strike terror and madness
into my rival and soon I'll see him
writhe, utter false cries, and, as a last resource,
try to balance himself on the nape
of his neck, like a forked pear tree, only to
roll over shamefully into the potato field....</p>

<p>All that will come to pass, Fire, exactly
as I've told it. To-day the future dawns in
your new flame.... I'm growing drowsy....
My purr and your crackling are ceasing
together.... I see you still and already
I catch glimpses of my dreams.... The
silky sound of the rain against the window
is soft as a caress, and the water-pipe on the
roof sobs low like a pigeon....</p>

<p>Don't go out during my nap, Fire. Remember,
you're the guardian of my august
repose&mdash;that delicate death, known as a
Cat's sleep....</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/148.gif" width="636" height="390" /></p>

<p><i>A suffocating summer's day in the country.
The blinds of the house are half closed.
Not a sound is heard from within; not a
murmur from the parched garden, where
even the sensitive leaves of the mimosa
hang motionless</i>.</p>

<p>KIKI-THE-DEMURE <i>and</i> TOBY-DOG <i>begin
to feel uncomfortably conscious of the coming
storm, which is yet but a slate-blue
plinth thickly painted at the bottom of the
dull blue sky-wall.</i></p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>restlessly lying first on one
side, then on the other</i>)</p>

<p>No use! I can't be comfortable. What
does this heat mean anyway? I must be
sick. It began at breakfast; I didn't like
the meat and sniffed disdainfully at my dog-biscuit.
Something awful is going to happen.
I haven't done anything wrong that I
know of&mdash;my conscience is clear&mdash;and yet,
I'm suffering. There lies my chum, shivering
and unable to sleep. I know by his quick
breathing that he feels just as I do.... I
say, Cat?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>irritably, in a low tone</i>)</p>

<p>Be quiet!</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>What? You're listening to some noise?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>No! <i>Heavens</i>, no! Don't mention noise.
The mere sound of your voice makes the skin
on my back go in waves like the sea.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG (<i>frightened</i>)</p>

<p>Are you going to die?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>I hope not. I've a sick headache. Can't
you see the arteries throbbing under the almost
hairless skin of my temples&mdash;the transparent,
bluish skin that denotes a thoroughbred?
It's atrocious! The veins on
my forehead are like writhing vipers, and
I don't know <i>what</i> gnome forges in my
brain! Oh, be quiet! Or at least speak so
low that the coursing of my agitated blood
may drown the sound of your voice....</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>But it's this very silence that oppresses
me. I tremble and don't know why. I long
for the familiar voice of the wind in the
chimney, the slamming of doors, the whispering
of the garden, the poplars' ceaseless
rustle&mdash;it always sounds like a trickling
spring&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>The uproar will come, soon enough.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Do you think so? I wish He'd scratch
paper. It's an idle habit but an honored one.
And see how listless She is, there in her
wicker chair. Their silence frightens me
more than anything. She seems asleep, but
I can see her eyelashes move and the tips of
her fingers, too. She's forgetting to play
with the little balls of thread and doesn't
sing, or whistle. She suffers just as we do....
Do you think this can be the end of the
world, Cat?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>No. It's a storm. Heavens! how uncomfortable
I am! If I could only get out
of my skin, cast off this fleece which is
smothering me, fling myself naked as a
skinned mouse into a fresher atmosphere!
Oh Dog, you cannot see the sparks that
make every separate hair on my body
crackle, but I feel them. Don't come near!
A blue flame is going to shoot out of me....</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/152.gif" width="580" height="175" /></p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG, (<i>shuddering</i>)</p>

<p>Things are coming to an awful pass!
(<i>He drags himself to the porch</i>.) <i>What</i>
have they done to the out-of-doors? Look!
the trees are all blue and the grass glistens
like a sheet of water. What mournful sunlight!
It shines white on the slate roofs,
and the little houses over there on the hill
look like brand new tombstones. A heavy
odor, like bitter almond, creeps from the
white bell-shaped blossoms of the daturas,
and makes me feel sick and faint. Far
away, some smoke, heavy as the perfume
of the daturas, goes slowly up in a straight
line and falls again&mdash;like a broken aigrette....
But come and see for yourself!</p>

<p>(KIKI-THE-DEMURE <i>walks falteringly
to the porch</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>My word, <i>you're</i> changed too, Cat! You
look as if you were starving, your face is
so drawn. Your fur is plastered down in
some places and sticking up in others; gives
you the expression of a weasel that had tumbled
into oil.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Don't let that worry you! I'll regain my
dignity&mdash;if ever another day dawns for us.
To-day, I drag myself around unwashed,
uncombed, like a woman out of love with love,
and life....</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>You say such distressing things. I think
I'll whine and call for help. Perhaps I'd
better go to Her, and look in her face for
the comfort you refuse me. But She seems
asleep now, in that wicker chair, and how can
I read my fate in her eyes, when their lids
are down. I'll lick her hand very respectfully
and ever so lightly! That will wake
her and oh, may her first caress drive away
the evil charm!</p>

<p>(<i>He licks the hand hanging
at the side of the chair</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">SHE, (<i>with a scream</i>)</p>

<p>Heavens! the apples!</p>

rather than leave this hiding-place!</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>invisible</i>)</p>

<p>I can't help hearing, and it's as if I saw
everything that's going on. She hastens to
close the windows. Someone is running on
the stairs. A&iuml;e! Another awful flame&mdash;and
everything is falling in! Silence now....
I wonder are they all dead? I'll look
through the fringes of the chair, though it's
risking my life to do so. Ah, hailstones
making holes in the leaves! Here comes the
rain, in silvery drops, wide apart, and so
heavy that the gravel wrinkles up when they
fall.</p>

<p class="center">SHE, (<i>heart-broken</i>)</p>

<p>I can hear the peaches falling, and the
green nuts too!</p>

<p>(<i>All three are silent. Rain;
quivering streaks of lightning;
hissing in the pine-trees.
The wind howls. A
lull</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>I'm not quite so afraid as I was. The
sound of the rain relaxes my tired nerves.
I seem to feel its streaming warmth on my
ears and the back of my neck. Now the
hubbub is further off! I can hear myself
breathe. The light coming under this bookcase,
is brighter than it was. What is She
doing? I daren't go out yet. If only the
Cat would move! (<i>He sticks out his head,
like a wary turtle. A flash of lightning
makes him draw it back again</i>.) Ha! It's
beginning all over again. Rain by the
bucketfuls against the window-panes. Something
in the chimney is trying to imitate that
far-away rumbling. Everything's falling to
pieces ... and <i>She</i> gave me a rap on the
nose!</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/158.gif" width="596" height="182" /></p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Drop by drop, a little brownish river is
filtering under the loose window-sash. It's
stretching out and out on the floor, winding
its way over to me. I'm so hot and
thirsty, I'd like to lap up some of it.
My joints ache and my ears are tired of
standing up like weather-cocks at every
crash. My jaws are still clenched with
nervous fear. The seat of this chair is too
low; it annoys me, rubbing against the fur
on my back. However, it's some comfort to
be able to <i>think</i> of such things&mdash;thanks to
the peace that's descended on the house.
The rain is falling quietly and the wind has
gone down, but the memory of the din still
hums in my ears. What can He be doing?
The storm distresses him too. Why didn't
He come forward to calm the raging elements?
There She is, opening the porch
door. Isn't it too soon?... No, for the
hens are cackling like old maids as they hop
over the puddles. We're going to have fine
weather. Oh, the adorable smell of wet
leaves and earth refreshed! It's so new, so
pure, I seem to breathe for the first time!</p>

<p>(<i>He creeps stealthily to the
porch</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG, (<i>suddenly</i>)</p>

<p>Um! How good! That smells like a
walk! Things change so quickly one hasn't
time to think. She's opened the door?
Let's run! (<i>He dashes out</i>.) Well! well!
the garden has got back its own color
again! A warmish vapor moistens my
rough-grained nose. I'm filled with the desire
to jump and run. The grass is reeking,
shining wet. Horned snails are feeling
around in the pink gravel with the tips of
their eyes, and speckled black and white
slugs embroider the wall with a silver ribbon.
Oh! what a beautiful green and gold
beastie running out there in the wet! Shall
I catch it? Shall I scratch its metallic shell,
until it breaks with a little crackling sound?
No. I'd rather stay near Her. She's leaning
against the door, taking deep breaths
and smiling quietly to herself. I'm <i>so</i>
happy! Something inside me feels grateful
to the whole world. The light is beautiful,
and I'm quite sure that there'll never, never
be another storm.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>I shan't wait any longer; I'm going out.
I'll find dry places between the puddles for
my dainty paws to step on. An imperceptible
thrill runs through the streaming
garden, making the jewels hung all about,
tremble and sparkle.... The slanting rays
of the setting sun find their reflection in my
eyes which are spangled with green and gold.
Down near the horizon, where the sky is still
unsettled, a glittering sword leaps up and
puts to flight the dark, fuming cloud-horses,
that have been galloping over our heads.
Now the odor of the daturas rises and perfumes
all the air, mingled with that of lemon
leaves, bruised by the hail. The roses are
crowned with midges. Oh sudden springtime!
An involuntary smile stretches the
corners of my mouth. I'm going to play at
tickling my nostrils with the point of a
sweet-smelling blade of grass, carefully
stretching my neck to avoid the falling
drops. But I want Him to follow and admire
me. Will He not come out and enjoy
himself with us?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>It's the contrary, with mine.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Really!</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>bitterly</i>)</p>

<p>Not to be wondered at! She clips them
for the sake of the hangings ... Well!
(<i>Magniloquently</i>), what can't be cured must
be endured.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>What are you going to do to-day?</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Why ... nothing.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG, (<i>ironically</i>)</p>

<p>For a change I suppose.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Pardon, to <i>avoid</i> change. What is this
rage for change that takes possession of
you all? Change means destruction. Only
that which remains stationary is eternal.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>I'm eternal then, these three hours past.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>But you've been out with Her, haven't
you? You came in like a whirlwind; bells
rang, clothes were shaken out, you were
sneezing and laughing and aureoled with icy
air.... The end of her nose felt so cold
when She kissed me on the forehead. She
always kisses me there, just over the dark
stripes forming the classic M, which She
assures me stands for miaou and for Minet,
my name in French.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Yes ... we had a fine run on the banks
of the fortifications, and then we went into
a shop.</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>Is that amusing?</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Not often. There are a great many
people crowded together. I'm immediately
seized with the fear of losing Her, and I
stick close to her heels, no matter what
comes. Strange feet push and knock me
about and step on my paws. I yelp but the
skirts all around stifle my voice.... When
we're out of it, we both look as if we'd been
shipwrecked ...</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE</p>

<p>May the gods preserve <i>me</i> from anything
of the sort! Here, the moments have glided
peacefully by. When She's not in this
house, there's nothing to hinder me; I employ
the time as my system of hygiene dictates.
After my breakfast of rosy liver
and milk, my kittenhood seems to come back
to me; I'm filled with a foolish gayety.
I go over to him. He's rumpling big, blackish
papers and welcomes me with a quiet
smile; we loll on the same divan, and revel
in a few idle moments together. Sometimes,
with imperious paw, I tear the paper He holds
like a screen between us. It always seems
to me the most desirable&mdash;the one that
crackles best. He cries out, and I throw
myself on my back and wriggle with joy
in a sort of horizontal dance, He calls
&quot;the dance of the bayadeer.&quot; Then somehow,
everything dwindles before my eyes,
grows dim, and far away; I want to rise and
go back to my cushion, but dreams already
separate me from the world ... Ah! blessed
hour when you and She disappear, when the
house is at rest and takes a long breath.
Soon I'm in the depths of a dark, sweet
sleep; my ears alone keep watch and turn
like sensitive antennas towards vague sounds
of doors and bells ...</p>

<p>I'm the darling little dog, so pretty! I
weigh only one pound, eleven ounces, my
collar is of gold, my ears of black satin,
lined with shiny rubber, my nails are polished
like the beaks of little birds. (<i>Catching
sight of</i> TOBY-DOG.) Oh!--someone&mdash;(<i>silence</i>).
He's rather good-looking.</p>

<p>(<i>They ogle and strut</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>How tiny she is!</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG</p>

<p>Sir&mdash;don't come near me.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG</p>

<p>I don't know. My mistress knows. She's
not here. She stayed in the other room.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>How old are you?</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG</p>

<p>Eleven months, (<i>reciting</i>) I'm eleven
months old. At the dog show, my mother
took first prize for beauty. I weigh only
one pound eleven ounces and&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>You've said that already. What makes
you so little?</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/174.gif" width="301" height="291" /></p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>from the piano</i>)</p>

<p>She's ugly, and has an evil odor. Her
paws are deformed, she can't stand still an
instant, and this dog takes pains to make
himself fascinating!</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG, (<i>very coquettish and talkative</i>)</p>

<p>It's my lineage, of course. One can hold
me in a muff. You've seen my new collar?
It's gold ...</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>And what's that hanging from it?</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG</p>

<p>My mother's medal, Sir. I always wear
it. I come from the <i>Palais de Glace</i>, where
I made quite a hit. Imagine! I wanted
to bite a gentleman who was speaking to my
mistress. <i>How</i> they laughed!</p>

<p>(<i>She wriggles and chirps</i>.)</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/175.gif" width="571" height="245" /></p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG, (<i>aside</i>)</p>

<p>What an odd creature! Is she <i>really</i>
a dog? (<i>Sniffs</i>.) Yes ... smells of rice
powder, but it's a dog just the same.
(<i>Aloud</i>.) Sit down a moment, it makes me
quite dizzy to see you moving about so.</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG</p>

<p>Certainly. (<i>She lies down, like a miniature
greyhound, crossing her fore-paws to
show the slimness of her toes</i>.) You were
here all alone?</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG, (<i>looking toward the piano</i>)</p>

<p>Yes, no other dog. Why?</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG</p>

<p>There's a strange odor.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>The Cat, doubtless.</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG</p>

<p>The Cat? What's a Cat? I've never seen
one. Do they leave you in the room all
alone?</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/176.gif" width="566" height="193" /></p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>It happens so now and then.</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG</p>

<p>And you don't bark? <i>I</i> cry as soon as
I'm left alone. I'm bored, afraid, feel sick,
and chew up the cushions.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>And then you're whipped.</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG, (<i>insulted</i>)</p>

<p>I'm&mdash;what did you say? You're losing
your senses, I imagine. (<i>Suddenly amiable
again</i>.) That would be a pity. You have
lovely eyes.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Haven't I? They show well, don't they?
They're large, and then they stick out. She
says I have eyes like a lobster's, and sometimes
She says &quot;his beautiful seal's eyes,
his frog-like eyes of gold.&quot;</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG</p>

<p>Who's She?</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG, (<i>simple</i>)</p>

<p>She.</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG</p>

<p>I don't understand all you say, but I
find you so <i>very</i> sympathetic! What are
you doing this evening?</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Why ... I dine.</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG</p>

<p>Naturally! I wanted to know whether
they receive here this evening, or do <i>you</i> go
out?</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>No, I've been out already.</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG</p>

<p>Driving?</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Walking&mdash;of course.</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG</p>

<p>Why, of course? I hardly stir except
in a carriage. Show me the underside of
your paws. Horrors! One would say 'twas
the stone they sharpen knives on! Look at
mine. Satin on top, velvet underneath.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>I'd like to see you in the country, on the
cobble-stones.</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG</p>

<p>I've been there, Sir. I was in the country
last summer and there weren't any cobble-stones.</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/179.gif" width="565" height="202" /></p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Then it wasn't the country. You don't
know what country means.</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG, (<i>vexed</i>)</p>

<p>Indeed I do, Sir! It's fine sand, and velvety
lawns that are swept every morning;
it's a reclining chair on the grass, great,
fresh cushions of cretonne, foamy milk,
naps in the shade, and charming little red
apples to play with.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG, (<i>shaking his head</i>)</p>

<p>No. It's the road covered with white powder
that makes the eyelids smart and the
paws burn, the tough, shriveled, sweet-smelling
grass, where I scratch my nose and my
gums; it's the fearful night&mdash;for I'm the
only one to guard them, He and She. I lie in
my basket, but the beating of my poor overdriven
heart keeps me awake. I hear a dog
crying to me from far off, that the Bad Man
has passed on the road. Is he coming in my
direction? Will I be obliged in another
minute, my eyes bloodshot and tongue dry
as chalk, to throw myself upon him and devour
his shadowy face? ...</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG, (<i>trembling and in ecstasy</i>)</p>

<p>Go on! Go on! Oh! how frightened I
am! ...</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG, (<i>modestly</i>)</p>

<p>Don't be afraid&mdash;it has never happened.
All that is the country, yes, and the interminable
hill, in the shadow of the carriage,
when thirst, hunger, heat and fatigue, render
the soul submissive and hopeless ...</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG, (<i>quite worked up</i>)</p>

<p>And then?</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Oh, nothing. One arrives at the house,
after all, and the pail of dark water,
one drinks without taking breath, (&quot;his
tongue,&quot; She says, &quot;his big tongue is parted
in the center, like an iris-petal&quot;) while
sore eyelids and dusty lashes are splashed
with cooling drops.... The country is all
that and many things besides....</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/182.gif" width="624" height="379" /></p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>on the piano, musingly</i>)</p>

<p>All that, yes...and the habits of the
year before that one finds again, molded to
one's shape, like a cushion marked with the
imprint of a long sleep...the long nights
of freedom, when the lone owlet, with his sad
little laugh, makes his way through the air
as quietly as I do on the ground, and silvery
gray rats cling to the vines, eating
grapes and keeping their eyes on me at the
same time. It's the sun-cure on the hot
stone-wall, from which I arise wan and
shrunken, baked through and through, but
svelte enough to make the youngest tomcat
envious. (<i>Coming back to the present
with a murderous look at</i> THE LITTLE DOG.)
Death to you, ill-smelling beast, for having
evoked these by-gone joys! Aren't you
going to disappear, that I may come down
from this cold pedestal, where my paws are
growing numb?</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG, (<i>enthusiastically to</i> THE LITTLE DOG)</p>

<p>But let us forget all that! With you
there, I can think of nothing but you. I feel
that I love you!</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG, (<i>lowering her eyes</i>)</p>

<p>Do you mean...really?</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Of course I do!</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG</p>

<p>So soon!</p>

<p class="center"><img border="0" alt=" " src="gifs/184.gif" width="416" height="238" /></p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>We've already wasted a great deal of
time.</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG</p>

<p>But ... we've been chatting. I've enjoyed
it very much ... and I fail to understand
why the society of young dogs like
you, is forbidden me ...</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>Allow me to make love to you.</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG</p>

<p>What's that?</p>

<p class="center">TOBY-DOG</p>

<p>I'll show you. First I hold myself very
erect, stiffen my legs, walk 'round you, barking
low and melodiously. My tail wriggles,
my ears ...</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG</p>

<p>Don't come near me. I feel quite upset.
(<i>Escaping</i>.) A&iuml;e! You unmannerly fellow!</p>

<p class="center">KIKI-THE-DEMURE, (<i>standing up</i>)</p>

<p>These preludes are indeed a sad parody
on our wild love-making ... (<i>aloud, very
angry</i>) I should think&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE DOG <i>looks to
see where the dreadful voice
is coming from, and espies
a strange striped monster

ferociously. She dashes

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
